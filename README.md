### Events Management API
The Events Management API is a backend solution designed for creating, managing, and broadcasting events in real-time. Built with Django and the Django REST framework, Django Channels are integrated to provide real-time functionality, enabling live updates and interactions between the server and clients through WebSockets.

# Architecture Overview and Tech Stack

- [architecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10kVHrsqvC6T65Sf1kl5xaVAtPtV7vc_V/view?usp=sharing)
The application is built on a modular architecture, with each component having a specific role and responsibility. Here's an overview of the architecture and the tech stack used:

## Events API

**Tech Stack:** Django and Django REST framework

**Role:** The Events API is the core interface for event CRUD operations. It handles client requests and responses.

## Database

**Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL

**Role:** The database provides reliable data persistence and complex querying capabilities for the application.

## Notifications Worker

**Tech Stack:** Django with Apscheduler

**GitHub Repo** [Notifications Worker](https://github.com/galnaaman/Alfabet_worker)

**Role:** The Notifications Worker periodically checks for imminent events and queues notifications for delivery.

## RabbitMQ

**Tech Stack:** RabbitMQ 

**GitHub Consumer Repo** [consumer](https://github.com/galnaaman/alfabet-consumer)

**Role:** RabbitMQ decouples long-running tasks from the main API, facilitating task distribution and asynchronous processing.

## Notification API

**Tech Stack:** Django REST framework

**Role:** The Notification API acts as a consumer of RabbitMQ messages and triggers notifications through external email and SMS service providers. **Didnt Actual devlop him just for the concept

## Redis

**Tech Stack:** Redis

**Role:** Redis manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication and caches frequent queries to enhance performance.

## WebSockets

**Tech Stack:** Django Channels

**Role:** WebSockets enable real-time notifications and live data updates to connected clients.

## JWT Authentication

**Tech Stack:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

**Role:** JWT Authentication protects endpoints and ensures that only authenticated users can subscribe to events and receive updates.

This architecture was chosen to leverage Django's strengthsâ€”a powerful ORM for database interactions, middleware support for seamless extension of HTTP request/response handling, and a well-supported ecosystem for building RESTful APIs. Django Channels add asynchronous support, crucial for implementing WebSocket communication, while Redis and RabbitMQ address performance and reliability concerns for real-time messaging and task queuing, respectively.
## System Flow


**Events API:** Clients interact with the Events API to create, update, or retrieve events. The API processes these requests and interacts with the PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.

**Real-Time Updates:**  On event updates, Django Channels handles real-time notifications. Each event has a dedicated WebSocket channel for broadcasting updates to subscribed clients.

**Notification Worker:** Scheduled tasks check for imminent events and enqueue notification messages in RabbitMQ, which manages these tasks without impacting the main API's performance.

**Message Queue Consumption:**  A separate consumer service processes the queued messages from RabbitMQ and communicates with the Notifications API.

**Notifications Dispatch:** The Notifications API triggers actions with external providers to send out emails or SMS messages to event participants, alerting them of upcoming events or changes.

**Caching and Session Management:** Redis caches frequent queries and stores session data to minimize database access and manage WebSocket connections efficiently.

**Security:** JWT authentication safeguards API endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users can trigger changes and receive notifications.



# API Documentation

## Events API

### `GET /api/v1/events/`

This endpoint retrieves a list of events. The response is paginated and each page contains 25 events.

#### Query Parameters

- `location`: Filter events by location. The value should be a string.
- `venue`: Filter events by venue. The value should be a string.
- `sort_by`: Sort events by date, popularity, or creation time. The value should be one of the following: `date`, `-date`, `popularity`, `-popularity`, `created`, `-created`.
- `page`: The page number to retrieve. The value should be an integer.

#### Response

A list of events. Each event object contains the following fields:

- `id`: The event ID.
- `name`: The event name.
- `description`: The event description.
- `location`: The event location.
- `venue`: The event venue.
- `start_time`: The event start time.
- `end_time`: The event end time.
- `participants`: A list of participant IDs.

### `POST /api/v1/events/`

This endpoint creates a new event.

#### Request Body

An event object containing the following fields:

- `name`: The event name.
- `description`: The event description.
- `location`: The event location.
- `venue`: The event venue.
- `start_time`: The event start time.
- `end_time`: The event end time.
- `participants`: A list of participant IDs.

#### Response

The created event object.

### `POST /api/v1/events/batch/`

This endpoint creates multiple new events.

#### Request Body

A list of event objects. Each event object should contain the same fields as described in the `POST /api/v1/events/` endpoint.

#### Response

A message indicating that the events were created successfully.

### `PUT /api/v1/events/batch/`

This endpoint updates multiple events.

#### Request Body

A list of event objects. Each event object should contain the same fields as described in the `POST /api/v1/events/` endpoint, plus an `id` field indicating the event to update.

#### Response

A message indicating that the events were updated successfully.

### `DELETE /api/v1/events/batch/`

This endpoint deletes multiple events.

#### Request Body

A list of event IDs to delete.

#### Response

A message indicating that the events were deleted successfully.

### `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}`

This endpoint retrieves the details of a specific event.

#### Path Parameters

- `event_id`: The ID of the event to retrieve.

#### Response

The event object.

### `PUT /api/v1/events/{event_id}`

This endpoint updates a specific event.

#### Path Parameters

- `event_id`: The ID of the event to update.

#### Request Body

An event object containing the fields to update.

#### Response

The updated event object.

### `DELETE /api/v1/events/{event_id}`

### `ws/events/{event_id}/`

This WebSocket endpoint is used to establish a real-time connection for a specific event.

#### Path Parameters

- `event_id`: The ID of the event to establish a WebSocket connection for.

#### Connection

To establish a WebSocket connection, the client should send a WebSocket connection request to `ws://<your-domain>/ws/events/{event_id}/`.

#### Messages

Once the connection is established, the server can send event-related messages to the client. The messages are JSON objects with the following field:

- `message`: A string containing the event-related message.

Here is an example of a valid message:

```json
{
    "message": "New participant joined the event."
}
```

#### Disconnection

The client can close the WebSocket connection at any time by sending a WebSocket close frame. The server will also close the connection if it no longer needs to send messages to the client.


### `POST /api/v1/token/`

#### Request

The request should be a POST request to the `/api/v1/token/` endpoint. The body of the request should be a JSON object with the following fields:
